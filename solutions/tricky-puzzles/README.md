## Puzzles

### 1. Count Zeros in a Binary Array (Without Conditionals)

Given an array `arr` that contains only the integers `0` and `2`, count the total number of `0`s present in the array.

**Constraints:**
- You must **not** use:
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `?:`, `switch`, etc.)
  - Loops (`for`, `while`, etc.)
- The array will only contain the numbers `0` and `2`.
- The array can be empty.

### 2. Puzzle: Find the Maximum of Two Numbers (Without Conditionals)

Given two numbers, `a` and `b`, find the maximum value without using any conditional statements (like `if-else` or ternary operators) or the built-in `max()` function.

### 3. Even or Odd (Without Conditionals)

Given an integer `n`, print "even" if `n` is even, and "odd" if `n` is odd.

**Constraints:**
- You must **not** use conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `?:`, `switch`, etc.).
- Only arithmetic operators are allowed.
